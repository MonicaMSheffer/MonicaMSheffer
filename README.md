## A little bit about me
Hi there! I am currently an NSF postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley in California, and soon to be an assistant professor at Cal Poly Humboldt, also in California. I study climate change impacts on arthropods across gradients (e.g. latitude, elevation), using a combination of ecological, physiological, molecular and experimental approaches. I am a naturalist and entomologist at heart.
